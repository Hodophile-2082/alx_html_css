TASK 1:
Adding display flex to the css starter file
When using display: flex; on a container, all direct children become flex-items (and no more inline or block elements).

With display flex, margins are not collapsing as they would with block items. Also remember that flexbox is 1-dimensional system (vs CSS Grid which is a 2 dimensional system)

In the /* Grid section within your CSS

Add a selector for the row class
Property: display, Value: flex
=> Now, all children from the row class are flex items

Entirely remove the row::after declaration
Remove the float: left inside [class*='col-']
=> All elements should appear same than before using the float

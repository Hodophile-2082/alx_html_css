TASK 1:
Adding display flex to the css starter file
When using display: flex; on a container, all direct children become flex-items (and no more inline or block elements).

With display flex, margins are not collapsing as they would with block items. Also remember that flexbox is 1-dimensional system (vs CSS Grid which is a 2 dimensional system)

In the /* Grid section within your CSS

Add a selector for the row class
Property: display, Value: flex
=> Now, all children from the row class are flex items

Entirely remove the row::after declaration
Remove the float: left inside [class*='col-']
=> All elements should appear same than before using the float
TASK2:
I have followed the following instructions:
Using the files from the previous task as the base for this task:

In the outermost section tag for services

Add the class section-services
In the outermost section tag for works

Add the class section-works
In the outermost section tag for about

Add the class section-about-us
In the outermost section tag for latest_news

 TASK 3:
 In your CSS file:

Before /*** 4. CARD ***/, add a new comment: /* Section Latest news ============================= */

Property: flex-direction, Value: row-reverse
The Latest news should appear in a reverse order.
 TASK 4:
